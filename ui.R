                                                    The WDCM organizes its knowledge of Wikidata usage into <b>semantic categories</b> and currently 
                                                    uses 14 of them. Each semantic category encompasses a set of Wikidata items that match a particular intuitive, 
                                                    natural concept (e.g. "Human", "Geographical Object", "Event", etc).<br>

                                                    semantic category. Each semantic model encompasses a number of topics, or semantic themes. Each topic is 
                                                    characterized by the importance of Wikidata items from the respective semantic category in that topic. 
                                                    Here you can browse the semantic categories and inspect the structure of topics that are encompassed 
                                                    by the respective semantic model. You can also learn about the most important projects in a given category 
                                                    for a given topic from its semantic model.<br>

                                                    and pick the first <i>Topic</i> from its semantic model. Use the drop-down menus to select a category 
                                                    and a topic from its semantic model. Three outputs will be generated on this page: the Top 50 items chart, the

                                          <p style="font-size:70%;">This Dashboard is a part of the <b>Wikidata Concepts Monitor (WDMC)</b>. The WDCM system provides analytics on Wikidata usage
                                                             across the Wikimedia sister projects. The WDCM Semantics Dashboard is probably the central and the analytically most complicated of all WDCM Dashboards. 
                                                             Here we provide only the necessary basics of distributional semantics needed in order to understand the results of semantic topic modeling presented on this 
                                                             WDCM dashboard. A user who needs to dive deep into the similarity structures between the Wikimedia sister projects in respect to their Wikidata usage patterns 
                                                             will most probably have to do some additional reading first. However, the Dashboard simplifies the presentation of the results as much as possible to make them 
                                                             accessible to any Wikidata user or Wikipedia editor who is not necessarily involved in Data or Cognitive Science. Reading through the <b>WDCM Semantic Topic Models</b> 
                                                             section in this page is <i>highly advised</i> to anyone who has never met semantic topic models or distributional semantics before. Before that, our next stop: Definitions.</p>

                                          <h4>Definitions</h4>
                                          <p style="font-size:80%;"><b>N.B.</b> The current <b>Wikidata item usage statistic</b> definition is <i>the count of the number of pages in a particular client project
                                                   where the respective Wikidata item is used</i>. Thus, the current definition ignores the usage aspects completely. This definition is motivated by the currently 
                                                   present constraints in Wikidata usage tracking across the client projects 
                                                   (see <a href = "https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/Schema/wbc_entity_usage" target = "_blank">Wikibase/Schema/wbc entity usage</a>). 
                                                   With more mature Wikidata usage tracking systems, the definition will become a subject 
                                                   of change. The term <b>Wikidata usage volume</b> is reserved for total Wikidata usage (i.e. the sum of usage statistics) in a particular 
                                                   client project, group of client projects, or semantic categories. By a <b>Wikidata semantic category</b> we mean a selection of Wikidata items that is 
                                                   that is operationally defined by a respective SPARQL query returning a selection of items that intuitivelly match a human, natural semantic category. 
                                                   The structure of Wikidata does not necessarily match any intuitive human semantics. In WDCM, an effort is made to select the semantic categories so to match 
                                                   the intuitive, everyday semantics as much as possible, in order to assist anyone involved in analytical work with this system. However, the choice of semantic 
                                                   categories in WDCM is not necessarily exhaustive (i.e. they do not necessarily cover all Wikidata items), neither the categories are necessarily 
                                                   mutually exclusive. The Wikidata ontology is very complex and a product of work of many people, so there is an optimization price to be paid in every attempt to 
                                                   adapt or simplify its present structure to the needs of a statistical analytical system such as WDCM. The current set of WDCM semantic categories is thus not 
                                                   normative in any sense and a subject  of change in any moment, depending upon the analytical needs of the community.</p>
                                          <p style="font-size:80%;">The currently used <b>WDCM Taxonomy</b> of Wikidata items encompasses the following 14 semantic categories: <i>Geographical Object</i>, <i>Organization</i>, <i>Architectural Structure</i>, 
                                          <i>Human</i>, <i>Wikimedia</i>, <i>Work of Art</i>, <i>Book</i>, <i>Gene</i>, <i>Scientific Article</i>, <i>Chemical Entities</i>, <i>Astronomical Object</i>, <i>Thoroughfare</i>, <i>Event</i>,

                                          <b><i>Wikidata Usage Patterns.</b></i> The <i>“golden line”</i> that connects the reasoning behind all WDCM functions can be non-technically described in the following way. Imagine observing the number of times a set of 
                                          size <b>N</b> of particular Wikidata items was used across some project (<i>enwiki</i>, for example). Imagine having the same data or other projects as well: for example, if 200 projects are under analysis, then we 
                                          have <b>200</b> counts for <b>N</b> items in a set, and the data can be desribed by a <b>N x 200</b> matrix (<i>items</i> x <i>projects</i>). Each column of counts, representing the frequency of occurence of all Wikidata 
                                          entities under consideration across one of the 200 projects under discussion - a vector, obviously - represents a particular <i>Wikidata usage pattern</i>. By inspecting and modeling statistically the usage pattern matrix - 
                                          a matrix that encompasses all such usage patterns across the projects, or the derived covariance/correlation matrix - many insigths into the similarities between Wikimedia projects items projects (or, more precisely, 
                                          the similarities between their usage patterns) can be found.
                                          <br>In essence, the technology and mathematics behind WDCM relies on the same set of practical tools and ideas that support the development of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search" target = "_blank">semantic search engines</a>

                                          topics, or semantic themes. Here you can select a semantic category (e.g. "Geographical Object", "Human") and a particular topic from its model. The page will produce three outputs: 
                                          (1) the <i>Top 50 items in this topic</i> chart, which presents the 50 most important items in the select topic of the selected category\'s topic model, (2) the <i>Topic similarity network</i>, 
                                                   which presents the similarity structure among the 50 most important items in the selected topic, and (c) the <i>Top 50 projects in this topic</i> chart, where 50 Wikimedia projects in which the

                                           semantic models do not necessarily encompass the same number of topics (in fact, they rarely do); also, <i>Topic n</i> in one category is obviously not the same thing as  <i>Topic n</i> in
