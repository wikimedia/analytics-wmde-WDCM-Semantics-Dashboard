                                                   <p><font size = 2>This Dashboard is a part of the <b>Wikidata Concepts Monitor (WDMC)</b>. The WDCM system provides analytics on Wikidata usage
                                                             across the Wikimedia sister projects. The WDCM Semantics Dashboard is probably the central and the analytically most complicated of all WDCM Dashboards. 
                                                             Here we provide only the necessary basics of distributional semantics needed in order to understand the results of semantic topic modeling presented on this 
                                                             WDCM dashboard. A user who needs to dive deep into the similarity structures between the Wikimedia sister projects in respect to their Wikidata usage patterns 
                                                             will most probably have to do some additional reading first. However, the Dashboard simplifies the presentation of the results as much as possible to make them

                                                   where the respective Wikidata item is used</i>. Thus, the current definition ignores the usage aspects completely. This definition is motivated by the currently 
                                                   present constraints in Wikidata usage tracking across the client projects 
                                                   (see <a href = "https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/Schema/wbc_entity_usage" target = "_blank">Wikibase/Schema/wbc entity usage</a>). 
                                                   With more mature Wikidata usage tracking systems, the definition will become a subject 
                                                   of change. The term <b>Wikidata usage volume</b> is reserved for total Wikidata usage (i.e. the sum of usage statistics) in a particular 
                                                   client project, group of client projects, or semantic categories. By a <b>Wikidata semantic category</b> we mean a selection of Wikidata items that is 
                                                   that is operationally defined by a respective SPARQL query returning a selection of items that intuitivelly match a human, natural semantic category. 
                                                   The structure of Wikidata does not necessarily match any intuitive human semantics. In WDCM, an effort is made to select the semantic categories so to match 
                                                   the intuitive, everyday semantics as much as possible, in order to assist anyone involved in analytical work with this system. However, the choice of semantic 
                                                   categories in WDCM is not necessarily exhaustive (i.e. they do not necessarily cover all Wikidata items), neither the categories are necessarily 
                                                   mutually exclusive. The Wikidata ontology is very complex and a product of work of many people, so there is an optimization price to be paid in every attempt to 
                                                   adapt or simplify its present structure to the needs of a statistical analytical system such as WDCM. The current set of WDCM semantic categories is thus not 
                                                   normative in any sense and a subject  of change in any moment, depending upon the analytical needs of the community.</font></p>

                                                   have <b>200</b> counts for <b>N</b> items in a set, and the data can be desribed by a <b>N x 200</b> matrix (<i>items</i> x <i>projects</i>). Each column of counts, representing the frequency of occurence of all Wikidata 
                                                   entities under consideration across one of the 200 projects under discussion - a vector, obviously - represents a particular <i>Wikidata usage pattern</i>. By inspecting and modeling statistically the usage pattern matrix - 
                                                   a matrix that encompasses all such usage patterns across the projects, or the derived covariance/correlation matrix - many insigths into the similarities between Wikimedia projects items projects (or, more precisely, 
                                                   the similarities between their usage patterns) can be found.
